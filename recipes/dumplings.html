    <title>HOMEMADE MANDU (KOREAN DUMPLINGS)</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>HOMEMADE MANDU (KOREAN DUMPLINGS)</h1>
    <p>Mandu (만두) are Korean dumplings filled with a different types of savory filling called “So (소)” and folded in different patterns. The style of dumplings vary across regions in Korea.</p>
    <h2>MANDU MADE FROM SCRATCH</h2>
    <p>Making homemade mandu has two components; dumpling wrappers and dumpling filling.</p>
    <ol>
        <li> DUMPLING WRAPPERS (MANDU-PI, 만두피)</li>
        <p>Don’t be afraid to make homemade dumpling wrappers from scratch. If you are looking for a true Korean mandu experience, I recommend my <a href="###">Homemade Korean Dumpling Wrappers</a> recipe.</p>
        <p>Korean dumpling dough contains flour, sweet rice flour, and a hint of cornstarch. Its unique tender and chewy texture sets it apart from other Asian dumpling wrappers.</p>
        <p>Store-bought dumpling wrappers are convenient and create tasty semi-homemade mandu. For Korean-style, seek large wrappers around 5 inches in diameter.</p>
        <li>DUMPLING FILLING (MANDU-SOK,만두속)</li>
        <p>Traditional Korean dumplings are made with minced pork. Its mild yet juicy flavor and texture mingles well with any vegetables you add. Chopped sour kimchi, mung bean sprouts, and tofu are typical filling ingredients to go with pork.</p>
        <p> I recommend using slightly fatty ground pork for the filling, about 80/20 meat to fat ratio. The fat makes the filling juicy and tender. Pork that is too lean yields a dry texture — you don’t want that.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Sprinkle 1 tsp salt on the chopped cabbage and let it soak for 10 minutes. When the cabbage becomes lifeless, squeeze it out to get rid of moisture.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Chop chives and leeks finely. If you can’t find Asian chives, increase the amount of green onion.</p>

    <h2>FOLDING DUMPLINGS</h2>
    <p>There are so many different shapes and patterns of folding dumplings. Here are the two of the most popular and easy.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>HALF MOON SHAPE</h3></li>
        <p>Half moon shaped dumplings are the most common in Korean dumplings. This shape is perfect for steaming and making soup. If you are thinking of making Korean dumpling soup, use this shape.</p>

        <img src ="https://www.beyondkimchee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/korean-dumplings-10-800x800.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 200px;">

        <li><h3>PLEATED SHAPE</h3></li>
        <p>Pleated shape is a great option for both steamed and pan fried dumplings. If you have never folded dumplings before, try with a small amount of filling inside first.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Put some filling in the middle of the wrapper and wet the edges with water using your finger.</li>
            <li>Bring one edge to the other and pinch in the center first, then make a small pleat on one side facing toward the center .</li>
            <li>Continue to make more pleats, usually about 4 pleats.</li>
            <li>Create the same number of pleats on the other side, facing the pleats toward the center.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
    <h2>COOKING MANDU</h2>
    <p>Learn how to steam, pan-fry, and semi deep-fry mandu (dumplings) with this quick and easy guide. Try both methods for delicious results!</p>
    <ol>
        <li><h4> STEAMING METHOD</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Bring a small amount of water in a large pot to boil. (Make sure the bottom of your steamer doesn’t touch the water.)</li>
            <li>Place dumplings without touching each other in a <a href="###">bamboo steamer</a> (or regular steamer), lined with a cheese cloth or a <a href="###">steam liner</a>.</li>
            <li>When the water boils, place the steamer over or in the pot.</li>
            <li>Cover and steam for 5 minutes.</li>
        
        </ul>
        <li><h4>PAN-FRY METHOD</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat a pan on medium-high with a couple tablespoons of oil in it.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, add dumplings (either fresh or frozen) in a single layer and cook until bottoms begin to brown, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Then add some water, about 3-4 tablespoon to create a steam. Turn the heat down to medium-low, and cover with a tight-fitting lid.</li>
            <li>Once the water has evaporated, it should take about 3 minutes for the bottoms of your dumplings to become crispy and brown. Remove the dumplings and serve.</li>
        </ul>
        </ol>
